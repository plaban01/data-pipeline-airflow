Data pipelines with Apache Airflow

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

This project creates an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

Apache Airflow is used as the tool to create data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills.

## Datasets
Following are the input datasets of this project:

Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data  
Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month.

# Data Model
Since the purpose of the database is for analytics, we are doing a dimensional modeling in the form of fact and dimension tables. The raw data resides in S3 in the form of JSON files. 

The database schema consists of the fact table fact_songplays along with dimension tables dim_artists, dim_songs, dim_users and dim_time. It is a star schema.

# Data Pipeline
Since the data resides in S3, it is first moved to staging tables in Redshift. Once the data is in the staging table, it is moved to the analytics tables by applying required transformations.

# Example analytic query
Find popular artists for each year and month:

select dt.year, dt.month, da.name, COUNT(*) as played_count  
from fact_songplays fs  
JOIN dim_artists da  
on fs.artist_id = da.artist_id  
JOIN dim_time dt  
on fs.start_time = dt.start_time  
GROUP BY dt.year, dt.month, da.artist_id, da.name  
ORDER BY played_count descending  
limit 10;
